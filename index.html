		<pre style = "font-size:120%; color:#A3A3FF;">
		I am a 10 gradth student from Fudan High School.
		Fudan Hight School is a school from Taiwan.
		You might thick why I am Taiwanese but using English to write this Intro.
		<b>(Poor grammer)</b>
		It is all because I set my editor to just can show English.
		So I cannot write Chinese. <b>(Too lazy to change editor)</b>
		I like coding, but not very good at it.
		This Intro is more like a practice.
